The segmentation module contains the segmentation functionality for RSGISLib.

A number of steps are required for the segmentation, for most users it is recommended to use the `run_shepherd_segmentation`
helper function which will run all the required steps to generate a segmentation:

.. code:: python

    from rsgislib.segmentation import segutils

    segutils.run_shepherd_segmentation(inImage,
                                     outputClumps,
                                     tmpath='',
                                     numClusters=60,
                                     minPxls=100,
                                     distThres=100,
                                     sampling=100, kmMaxIter=200)

Where 'inImage' is the input image (optionally masked and stretched) and 'outputClumps' is the output clumps file.

More information about the segmentation method is available in the following paper:
